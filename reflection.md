**Meetings**

Outside of the labs we meet twice to both work on the project (code and tests) and discuss our plans and how to work together. 

The first time we met was for around three hours on Wednesday before our lab. In this meeting we initially focused on talking about how we planned to work on the project. The first step in doing this was to break the project and its functionality into logical chunks and then assign each member the functionality that they would work on for the first iteration. After this we talked briefly about user stories and determined that we should complete at least one user story for each part of functionality. Finally we began to work on the code of the project proper and walked through how to make and complete merge requests.

The second time that we met was on Friday for about an hour. At this meeting we decided to focus primarily on starting work on the reflection for this iteration of the project and also worked on some more code. This gave us a chance to talk about what we had done since Wednesday face-to-face and to clear up some slight issues and complete a few merge requests.

**Responsibilities**

As for determining responsibilities we decided that the easiest way to do this was to just split the functions to be coded into four even parts, eight functions each, and work on those individually. Something that naturally followed on from this was user stories, each function in this iteration of the project relates quite strongly to a goal that a user might want and so each member of the team wrote at least one user story for each function that they were assigned to work on. Apart from that we all worked on the reflection and plan together.

**Collaboration/Teamwork**

Our team worked more or less, well together. Merge requests and the like were accepted regularly and any issues raised were usually dealt with quickly. Furthermore through the meetings we had we were able to talk through any problems people were having either conceptually or with regards to code and fix any major problems people had quite easily. Finally, the division of responsibilities seemed fair which is always conducive to good teamwork.

**Improvement**

One of the biggest things that can likely be improved upon for the next iteration is how soon we start working. Although we didnâ€™t start work on the project too late by any measure it would be preferable to start earlier for the next iteration and work more consistently rather than in short bursts of activity.
