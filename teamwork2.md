**Reflect on your use of agile practices and how you worked as a team.**

_Your reflection should, at a minimum, include:_
  * _How often you met, and why you met that often_
  * _What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful_
  * _What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 3_
  * _Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code_

_Write this in `teamwork.md`._
