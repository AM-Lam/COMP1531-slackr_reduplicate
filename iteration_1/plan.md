1) Estimate the time they take, 
2) Break them up into logical buckets, 
3) Figure out the order in which you would implement the requirements

I am working on message_send to user_profile.
1. I will take a week to understand how should I code the function. Each function should take about 3-6 hours. Debugging and testing should take 2 hours each. If I do each function per day week 5 onward, I will be able to finish my part by the end of week 6. Therefore, deadline among our group will be on Thursday or Friday during week 6 and we will gather and make sure everyone is on the same page.
2. Our group breaks down all the tasks into 3 aspects: users, channels and messages. I am in charge of all the messages and user profile.
3. We will first implemente the basic information of the user like register and login. Then it will be basic of channels, like create, join, invite. We will include the authorisation in channels based on every user at this time. After that, the functions of message will be implemented. Finally, we will work on features like standup in the code.
