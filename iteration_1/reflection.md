We divided the user stories into 4 piles. Everyone is doing 8 functions each. 
We met up at Wednesday to talk about what we have to do as a group and make sure everyone has the same interpretation or idea about the iteration 1.
We gathered up on Friday and Satursday at week 3 to keep working on the project.
