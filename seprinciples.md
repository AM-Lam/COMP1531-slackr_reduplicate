**Demonstrate software engineering design understanding**

_Refactor or add to your code from iteration 2 to utilise good software engineering design to make your code more maintainable. Use a range of principles discussed in lectures._

_As you modify your code, maintain a up to a 2 page markdown file that lists the key changes you've made in your code and why they've been made._

_Write this in `seprinciples.md`._
