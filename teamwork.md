# From Iteration one
- Things should be done last iteration
Our task board is now divided into 3 catagories - user, channel and message. It helps to distinguish the characteristic of the functions.

# What we have improved
In terms of communication, we make used of communication software instead of meetup. We talk to each other when we modified something from public files like server.py and database.py. Since we merge more often, we also proofread each others' code before we actually merge our code into master.

# Challenges that we faced as a team
## Time Limit
It is due in the midterm so some people might have several assignments due in the same week which leads to more intense pressure. It is also harder to meet up face-to-face since we have more engagements in other courses. 

## Implementing the database
Throughout the whole iteration 2, we made a lot of modification in the database. It is based on our 3 key components - user, channel and message. We are using class to structure our database whhich allow us to plan out the attribute and method. While we working on our parts, we add helper functions as class method which require us to communicate as a team more often since someone else might make the similar functions or it will cause merge conflict if we are not all aware of the changes.

## Connecting frontend and backend
(I didn't do anything for frontend. But i guess it breaks the functions that we have right now? Or found out that the format of returning output is wrong)

## Divided functions
The way that we divide the work make us to work with functions simultaneously. However, the functions are seldom having to wait til the previous function to be done. For example, almost all the functions need auth/register in order to check the token. Therefore, we would hardcode the related information in order to do testing.

# What we can improve next time
We can implement the function earlier.
We should test the frontend earlier.
