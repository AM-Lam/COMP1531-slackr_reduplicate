# From Iteration one
- Things should be done last iteration
Our task board is now divided into 3 catagories - user, channel and message. It helps to distinguish the characteristic of the functions.

# meeting detail
- 19/10 15 minutes (Owen and Ann) Talked about the flask operations and database.py
- 21/10 30 minutes Talked about the outline of the database.py like what attributes to put into class user, channel and message
- 23/10 1.5 hours (Group) Draft of server.py and database.py is done. Talked about what functions and possible test cases. And also adding some methods into the classes of database.py
- 15/10 15 minutes (Owen and Arpit) Debugging the stub functions. Discussing about integrating frontend and backend.

# Communication/Time management
For iteration 2 we needed more time as compared to iteration one which was only writing tests. There was alot of work to be done including writing all the functions and writing more tests to make sure that all the code being implemented has been tested. To make sure everything was completed in a timely manner, we set the deadline to have basic functionality by Friday night(25/10).This helped us use the remaining time for running tests again and orgnising the whole project, into a neat little pakage. 
The assurance and teamwork files were creates as google docs at the start of the iteration so we all could keep contributing to the two documents as we wnt along.
We use the messenger group chat to keep in constant touch with the team and to do progress checks every once a while. 
We usually meet up when we have bugs in our code or we need some clarification for which we need to get the consensus of the whole group about aspects such as how database should be set up. 
Team members proofread each others code before having the merge request submitted on gitlab.

# What we have improved
In terms of communication, we have made a better use of communication tools. We talk to each other when we modifiy something from public files like server.py and database.py. Since we merge more often, we also proofread each others' code before we actually merge our code into master.

# Challenges that we faced as a team
## Time Limit
It is due in the midterm so some people might have several assignments due in the same week which leads to more intense pressure. It is also harder to meet up face-to-face since we have more engagements in other courses. 

## Implementing the database
Throughout the whole iteration 2, we made a lot of modification to the database. It is based on our 3 key components - user, channel and message. We are using classes to structure our database which allow us to plan out the attributes and methods. While we were working on our functions, we have added helper functions as class method which require us to communicate as a team more often since someone else might make a similar function leading to a merge conflict. When making changes to the database it was also very important for everyone to keep up to date with all the changes happening.

## Connecting frontend and backend
There were issues we faced when trying to connect the frontend to the backend. This is an aspect of the iteration that needs work.

## Divided functions
Most of the functions in this project are inter-dependent on each other. If a particular function was not complete, then that brought the need to have to manipulate data within the tests.

# What we can improve next time
We should implement the function earlier.
We should test the frontend earlier.
Set a deadline that would allow us to have atleast a week to make changes.
