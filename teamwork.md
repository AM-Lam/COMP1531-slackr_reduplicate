# From last iteration
- Things should be done last iteration
    Modifying the database and all the functions in the last iteration.
    Making the frontend connected with backend

# meeting detail
- 06/11 60 minutes Talked about what we can modify from last iteration and how can we improve the database.py.
- 13/11 60 minutes Talked about the outline of the database.py like what attributes to put into class user, channel and message


# What we have improved
In terms of communication, we have made a better use of communication tools. We talk to each other when we modifiy something from public files like server.py and database.py. Since we merge more often, we also proofread each others' code before we actually merge our code into master. 
We also refactor our code by adding decorators to our test cases and rewrite some of the functions based on the DRY and KISS principals.
We work as a group more often since we review and modify codes more often. Refactor is done by basically everyone so we are not only in charge of part of the codes but also the project as a whole.

# Challenges that we faced as a team
## Merge conflict
We encounter more merge conflict since we modify each others code more often and refactoring also means that our original codes got move around quite a lot. 
We told our teammates in messenger so that they will pull the latest version and solve the conflict as soon as possible.

# What we can improve next time
We should talk over the whole thing before we started the project. It will make our life easier if we realise how many overlapping between our functions are and made the public helper fucntions earlier.
