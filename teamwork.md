# Meetings

During this section of the project we met in-person for two meetings. Unfortunately travel was an issue for some members of our team and so we could not meet face-to-face more often but we did stay in regular communication other messaging apps. Meetings rarely followed an exact structure but at the beginning of every meeting (and regularly online) we made each member of the team explain:

- What they had done,
- What problems they faced, and,
- What they were planning on doing.

Below is a brief record of the two in-person meetings we held.

- 06/11 60 minutes Talked about what we can modify from last iteration and how can we improve database.py.
- 13/11 60 minutes Talked about the outline of the new data-structures (what attributes to put into class user, channel, message, etc.) and how to use the new functions.

# Agile Methodology

We only loosely followed an Agile methodology but made use of user stories to keep track of what had to be done and what had been completed. After a function had been written, passed all backend tests and appeared to work on the front-end we marked it as closed. On top of this we should have made greater use of story points and updated the issues board more frequently.

# Improvements in Iteration 3

In terms of communication, we made better use of communication tools. Whenever changes were made we ensured that everyone was updated with the changes. We also added comments making the changes easier to understand. Because we merged more often, more of us reviewed other team-member's code before it was merged into the master branch. We worked as a group more often and reviewed and modified code more often. Refactoring was done by everyone so we were not only in charge of part of the codes but also the project as a whole. As a result of this there was a greater level of discussion about the project and about how to implement certain features and fixes.

# Challenges

## Merge conflicts
In the third iteration there were many merge conflicts as we condensed most functions into single files and people were working on a broader section of functionality than they had been in earlier iterations. To easily manage and handle these merge conflicts, we committed and pushed our code to master as often as possible when makings changes that might have affected others. This allowed us to stay up to date with new changes and work together efficiently. We also tried to ensure that when working people were using the most up-to-date version of the codebase.

## Remote Communication
We could not get together and work or do stand-ups very often due to some of the team members living far from the university. We could not work very effectively due to this and had to manage work and code over online chats and this slightly hindered our planning and execution.

# Possible Improvements

We need to improve communication between team members. It would be a good idea to have a pre-commit message script, that would not allow other team members to commit their changes until all of the tests pass in order to make sure the code works, because sometimes non functional code was pushed. Next time we should use more diagrams to design data structures like the database to decrease the number of changes that were constantly being made to the database.
