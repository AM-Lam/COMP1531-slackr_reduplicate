# From last iteration
- Things should be done last iteration
    Modifying the database and all the functions in the last iteration.

# meeting detail
- 06/11 60 minutes Talked about what we can modify from last iteration and how can we improve the database.py.
- 13/11 60 minutes Talked about the outline of the database.py like what attributes to put into class user, channel and message


# What we have improved
In terms of communication, we have made a better use of communication tools. We talk to each other when we modifiy something from public files like server.py and database.py. Since we merge more often, we also proofread each others' code before we actually merge our code into master.

# Challenges that we faced as a team
