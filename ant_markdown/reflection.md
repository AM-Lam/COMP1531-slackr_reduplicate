	As an individual group member, I have definitely appreciated the direction our group has taken, as we have efficiently managed our time and have completed our iteration with time to spare. I don't think there has been any friction, and I believe our team is very good at co-operating and corresponding with each other. My only anxiety is directed at myself, in that I'm worried that I may be letting down my team. However, in the absence of evidence pointing to that fact, I will choose to believe that I am equally contributing to our iteration.

We have each developed a wide array of tests for our test functions, and have even been able to expand upon our actual functions, at least in terms of returning exceptions and errors. Our user stories have also been plentiful and have personally shaped how I am approaching this project.
